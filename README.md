Hello 

On this project its a example of the webpage farfetch, learning javascript, when i was in the course Front End Web Developer by Flag.

The header when you make scroll its fixed, gets smaller and it has a counter on the right side.

Next its a slideshow making all the functions with timer, arrows and dots, that change the photos.

Then we have an countdown saying the days, hours, minuts and seconds, changing day by day and second by second.

The photos its a grid with class highlights, that you clivck on the like button nad insert one or more likes on the counter in the header.

Now we have a faqs, that when is cliked, it dropes a answer for the question that you click.

The footer as a form to subscrive the page and a class back to top, when is cliked it goes up on the page.

Cheers
